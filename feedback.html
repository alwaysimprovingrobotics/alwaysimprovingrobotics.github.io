			<b>Katya Vert-Wong</b> <i>CEO, Nostopharma:</i><br>
			<p>I experienced AIM and am very impressed with how the team combined visual design elements with useful functionality of recycling.
				AIM is very versatile because the cards can distribute variety of content.
				The cards are ingenious idea to share kids' passion for arts and STEM, to distribute information or just motivate more community events and recycling.
				I envision that JLABS can install the AIM in all Innovation Hubs to help connect robotics team work with the real-life innovative work.</p>
			<br>

			<b>Frank Feng</b> <i>(Clarinet Master, Tianjin Symphony Orchestra):</i><br>
			<p>I like the way how you are sharing your hobbies.
				One of the most attractive things in your design is to use the recycled materials to make the instruments. This allows many children who cannot afford to buy an instrument to start learning music.
				And I will share my experience with you on how to make cheap instruments by yourselves. </p>
			<br>

			<b>Sai Chiang</b> <i>(Project Leader, NASA):</i><br>
			<p>Cool website and lots of good ideas. I have to keep on reminding myself you are 5th to 7th graders. I've learned a lot from your "Hobby Cards".
				One suggestion, when you deploy the AIM outdoor, you may think about using the solar panels, which you've learned in last season.</p>
			<br>

			<b>Antonios Zoulis</b> <i>(Branch Chief, Nuclear Regulatory Commission):</i><br>
			<p>I'm so impressed by your ideas. And it's amazing that you cut the cost of your prototype by 10 times from version 1 to version 2.
				You may think about putting a sign to let people know they will get a prize if they recycle.
				You may also install a sensor to detect if there are pedestrians passing by, then play a prompt voice.</p>
			<br>

			<b>Kejun Cheng</b> <i>(Senior Chemist, FDA):</i><br>
			<p>I love this great idea as it uses a fun way to raise awareness about environmental protection.
				One minor suggestion is that you may try to use "Hobby cards" made from recycled materials.</p>
			<br>

			<b>Jiankang Jin</b> <i>(Famous Artist of Oil Painting):</i><br>
			<p>When I browsed your website, I was amazed by your "masterpiece". What a great platform to share your interests and hobbies!
				I hope you will continue to enrich your hobby cards. You may also provide a way to allow children to upload and share their own paintings.</p>
