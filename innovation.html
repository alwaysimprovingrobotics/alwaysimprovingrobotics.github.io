			<div class="title">2023-2024 Masterpiece</div>
			<div class="title2">Introduction</div>
			<hr>
			<p>This year’s innovation project topic for the First Lego League is “Masterpiece,” where members aim to connect art and technology together in order to showcase their hobbies and interests in the arts through the usage of technology.</p>

			<div class="title2">Our Purpose</div>
			<hr>
			<p>The purpose of our Innovation Project, AIM, is to share our hobbies and interests with others as much as possible, and encourage other people to recycle and save our planet.</p>
			
			<div class="title2">Our Idea</div>
			<hr>
			<p>In order to fit this theme, our team spent a long time brainstorming for an idea, and eventually utilized the idea of “hobby cards” in order to express our interests. The hobby card is the same size as the business cards. On these hobby cards, members put a photo and a short description about a hobby or an activity that they enjoy. Some of our members also created cards featuring short projects that the user can create, such as arts and crafts set out of bottle caps, or instruments made of recycled plastic. Through the inclusion of a QR code, the user is linked to a longer description that contains more information about the topic on the card.</p>
			<p>We also printed our email address on the cards. We welcome others to share their hobbies by sending us emails.</p>
			
			<div class="title2">AIM</div>
			<hr>
			<img src="innovation/AIM_2.0.png" width="116" height="320" style="float: left;margin-right: 16px;">
			<p>Our machine, AIM, which stands for AI’s Masterpiece, is inspired by Porky the Little Eater at Cabin John Regional Park. AIM will allow users to insert a material that can be recycled in exchange for one of our hobby cards, and is specifically designed to be portable and weather-proof. The machine is meant to be situated on top of a recycling bin to encourage more recycling throughout our community by using a reward system while also sharing our hobbies.</p>
			<p>When people push the flap to throw something in, a sensor will detect the flap going upwards. It will then trigger a motor, which dispenses a card. It also triggers an MP3 player that plays audio to remind people to take the card. Then, people can take the card and find something interesting on it.</p>
			<p>We created two versions of the card dispenser. The first prototype is made of LEGO pieces, it costs more than 400 dollars, which is too expensive. Therefore, we chose for a cheaper popular hardware Arduino board for the second prototype, which costs about 45 dollars.</p>

			<p>Our next step is to install Wi-Fi on the card dispenser, allowing it to send a message to the manager if it runs out of cards or the sensor detects that the recycle bin is full. We also plan to use solar panels to provide power, then it could be installed on outdoor recycle bins.</p>
